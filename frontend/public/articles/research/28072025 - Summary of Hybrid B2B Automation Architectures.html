<p>Automating B2B workflows needs hybrid systems combining <strong>Rule-Based Automation (RBA)</strong>, <strong>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</strong>, and <strong>Generative AI (GenAI)</strong>. This strategy tackles unstructured data and complex decisions, using RBA/RPA for execution and GenAI for cognitive tasks. The paper details architectures, data flow, governance, and case studies, showing how this integration boosts efficiency and redefines human roles.</p>
