<p>This paper analyzes employee monitoring using local AI and video. It details the tech (cameras, edge AI for object detection, pose estimation, activity recognition) and highlights limitations like accuracy issues and biases. Crucially, it examines <strong>GDPR compliance</strong>, <strong>psychological impact</strong>, and <strong>ethical challenges</strong>, advocating for responsible implementation focused on supportive analytics over pure surveillance, given that such systems can actually harm productivity.</p>
