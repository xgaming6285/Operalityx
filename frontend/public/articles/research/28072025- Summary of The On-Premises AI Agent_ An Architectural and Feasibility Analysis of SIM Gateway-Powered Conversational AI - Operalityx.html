<p>This paper analyzes building an on-premises AI call center with a SIM gateway. It details the architecture, from hardware to AI integration using RAG and fine-tuning for proprietary knowledge. The viability of SIM gateways is critically examined, revealing high technical and legal risks (TCPA, GDPR, carrier blocking) despite perceived &quot;free&quot; calls. A TCO analysis shows this model is significantly more expensive long-term than cloud CPaaS due to high CapEx and operational overhead. The conclusion is that while sovereign AI is a strong vision, the SIM gateway approach is fundamentally untenable, requiring a pivot to licensed telecom for viability.</p>
