<p>The Infinitus Framework proposes a self-improving, autonomous multi-agent AI system for 24/7 operation with infinite context. It uses an <strong>Orchestrator-Executor model</strong> with <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> and <strong>continual learning</strong> for private, offline deployment. Key challenges include <strong>error propagation</strong>, <strong>security (data poisoning)</strong>, and <strong>computational overhead</strong>, demanding robust mitigation and Explainable AI (<strong>XAI</strong>). Potential uses span scientific discovery to autonomous business, but ethical risks like accountability, bias, and job displacement require careful governance.</p>
